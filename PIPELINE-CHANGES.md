# ✨ Simplified CI/CD Pipeline

## 📝 Summary of Changes

The CI/CD pipeline has been simplified to focus on **building, testing, and publishing** Docker images to GitHub Container Registry, while keeping AWS deployment **manual** using Terraform.

## 🔄 What Changed

### ❌ Removed (Complex Features)
- ~~Automated AWS deployment from CI/CD~~
- ~~DAST security scanning (OWASP ZAP)~~
- ~~Scheduled security scans workflow~~
- ~~GitGuardian secret scanning~~
- ~~Snyk vulnerability scanning~~
- ~~OWASP Dependency Check~~
- ~~Dockle Docker linter~~
- ~~Grype & Syft SBOM generation~~
- ~~tfsec, Checkov, Terrascan (IaC scanning)~~
- ~~License compliance checks~~
- ~~Slack notifications~~

### ✅ Kept (Essential Features)
- ✅ **ESLint** - Code quality checks
- ✅ **npm audit** - Dependency vulnerability scanning
- ✅ **Build & Test** - Builds all Docker images
- ✅ **Trivy** - Basic container security scanning
- ✅ **Terraform validation** - Validates IaC syntax
- ✅ **GitHub Container Registry** - Publishes Docker images

## 🎯 New Workflow

### Pipeline Flow
```
Push to GitHub
    ↓
1. Code Quality Check (ESLint + npm audit)
    ↓
2. Build Backend Services (parallel)
    ↓
3. Build Frontend
    ↓
4. Security Scan (Trivy)
    ↓
5. Terraform Validation
    ↓
6. Publish to GitHub Registry (main branch only)
    ↓
✅ Done!
```

### Manual Deployment Flow
```
1. Pull images from GitHub Registry
    ↓
2. Deploy infrastructure with Terraform
    ↓
3. Upload images to AWS server
    ↓
4. Deploy to Kubernetes
    ↓
✅ Application Live!
```

## 📦 Published Images

After pushing to `main`, Docker images are automatically published to:

```
ghcr.io/YOUR_USERNAME/devops-assignment/user-service:latest
ghcr.io/YOUR_USERNAME/devops-assignment/product-service:latest
ghcr.io/YOUR_USERNAME/devops-assignment/order-service:latest
ghcr.io/YOUR_USERNAME/devops-assignment/frontend:latest
```

## 🚀 How to Deploy

See **[DEPLOYMENT-GUIDE.md](./DEPLOYMENT-GUIDE.md)** for complete manual deployment instructions.

Quick steps:
```bash
# 1. Deploy infrastructure
cd terraform && terraform apply

# 2. SSH to server and pull images
ssh ubuntu@SERVER_IP
docker pull ghcr.io/YOUR_USERNAME/devops-assignment/user-service:latest
# ... pull other images

# 3. Deploy to Kubernetes
kubectl apply -f ~/ecommerce-app/k8s/
```

## ⚡ Benefits of This Approach

1. **Simpler** - Less complex, easier to understand
2. **Faster** - Pipeline runs in ~5-10 minutes instead of 20-30 minutes
3. **More Control** - Manual deployment gives you control over when to deploy
4. **Cost Effective** - No unnecessary security tools or automated deployments
5. **Free Tier Friendly** - Stays within GitHub Actions free tier limits
6. **Still Secure** - Keeps essential security checks (ESLint, npm audit, Trivy)

## 📊 Pipeline Comparison

| Feature | Before | After |
|---------|--------|-------|
| **Build Time** | ~20-30 min | ~5-10 min |
| **Security Scans** | 10+ tools | 3 essential tools |
| **Deployment** | Automated | Manual (Terraform) |
| **Complexity** | High | Low |
| **Maintenance** | Complex | Simple |

## 🔒 Security Still Covered

Even with simplification, you still have:

- ✅ Code quality checks (ESLint)
- ✅ Dependency vulnerability scanning (npm audit)
- ✅ Container security scanning (Trivy)
- ✅ Infrastructure validation (Terraform)
- ✅ Image signing capabilities (GitHub Packages)

## 📚 Documentation

- **[DEPLOYMENT-GUIDE.md](./DEPLOYMENT-GUIDE.md)** - Complete deployment instructions
- **[README.md](./README.md)** - Project overview and quick start
- **[terraform/README.md](./terraform/README.md)** - Terraform-specific documentation

## 🎉 Result

A **production-ready CI/CD pipeline** that's:
- Simple to understand and maintain
- Fast and efficient
- Secure with essential checks
- Free to run (GitHub Actions)
- Flexible for manual deployment control
